# Welcome! 🙂

I'm an undergraduate student majoring in [Mechanical Engineering](https://me.snu.ac.kr/en/) at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html).

My research interests lie in Robotics, with a specific focus on Spatial Intelligence, Perception and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). I aim to bridge the gap between how robots understand the real world and how they physically interact with it in dynamic environments.
